## Actual Phase definitions (from code)

### Phase 2C3
- `POST /accounting/journals/:id/reverse`
- Permission: `finance.voucher.reverse`
- Service: `journal-reverse.service.ts`
- Event key: `MANUAL_JOURNAL_REVERSE:{id}:V1`
- Effect: new REVERSAL voucher, Dr↔Cr swap, original → REVERSED, JO- number kept

### Phase 3D
- Receipt alloc reverse: `…/receipts/:id/allocations/:batchId/reverse` (`finance.ar.allocation.reverse`) — **no GL**
- Receipt doc reverse: `…/receipts/:id/reverse` (`finance.ar.receipt.reverse`) — REVERSAL voucher
- CN alloc reverse: `…/credit-notes/:id/allocations/:batchId/reverse` — **no GL**
- CN doc reverse: `…/credit-notes/:id/reverse` (`finance.ar.credit_note.reverse`) — REVERSAL voucher
- **Does not include** sales invoice document reverse

### Phase 4A1
- Tables: `vendor_invoices`, `vendor_invoice_lines`, `vendor_invoice_source_links`, `payable_open_items`
- Migration: `20260718150000_add_vendor_invoice_and_ap_open_item_foundation`
- Repos under `backend/src/modules/accounting/payables/`; permissions `finance.ap.*` seeded
- **No HTTP routes**, calculation, posting, payment, allocation, or frontend

### Phase 4A2
- Calculation/validation engine under `backend/src/modules/accounting/payables/vendor-invoices/calculation/`
- `calculateVendorInvoiceSync` (pure) / `calculateVendorInvoice` (async, DB-optional); duplicate detector (live DB); account resolver; accounting-preview builder
- Rules doc: [`AP_CALCULATION_RULES.md`](AP_CALCULATION_RULES.md)
- **No HTTP routes**, persistence writes, posting, payment, allocation, or frontend
- Next: **4A3** draft workflow + HTTP API
